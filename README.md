# Allegro-Music-Player
Allegro is a simple yet fully functional music player for the Android platform. Allegro benefits from Google's Material design and offers support for Persian language for its interfaces.

Allegro was originally planned as a commercial product, developed in collaboration with a friend of mine, Iman Akbari.
Development is discontinued.
